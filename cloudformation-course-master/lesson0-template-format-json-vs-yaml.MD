## AWS CloudFormation Template Formats
You can write AWS CloudFormation templates in JSON or YAML formats. 

I love using Cloudformation to define infrastructure, create resources quickly. Cloudformation has varuious benefits: 

- Version control your infrastructure
- Predictably and reliably deploy infrastructure at speed
- Perform testing on different environmentiont easier than ever. 

Infrastructure as code has a huge promise. 



## What language is this code written in? 
There are 2 options for you to write cloudformation templates. 
1) JSON: this use to be the only option until AWS introduced YAML support to write cloudformation templates
2) YAML:
  - Human friendly readable syntax. 
  - You can write comments on a YAML cloudformation template using # 
  - No Brackets ,  but indentation
